# Advent of Code

This repository contains code submissions for the 
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) yearly programming challenges.

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill 
levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who 
wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. 
Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

I will be doing Javascript this year, 2023!
